    <h2>Particle Cloud Generation with Message Passing Generative Adversarial Networks</h2>
    <p>In high energy physics (HEP), jets are collections of correlated particles produced ubiquitously in particle collisions such as those at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
      Machine-learning-based generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), have the potential to significantly accelerate LHC jet simulations.
      Despite jets having a natural representation as a set of particles in momentum-space, a.k.a. a particle cloud, there exist no generative models for such a dataset.
      We introduce a new particle cloud dataset (JetNet), and apply existing point cloud GANs to it.
      Existing GANs are found to be inadequate for physics applications, hence we develop a new message passing GAN (MPGAN), which outperforms existing point cloud GANs.
      We propose JetNet as a novel point-cloud-style dataset for the machine learning community to experiment with, and set MPGAN as a benchmark to improve upon for future generative models.

    <h2>Search for Higgs boson decays into long-lived particles in associated Z boson production</h2>
    <p>We present a search for long-lived particles (LLPs) produced in association with a Z boson.
      The search is performed with data from 13 TeV proton-proton collisions recorded by the CMS experiment during 2016-2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 117 fb\(^{-1}\).
      The LLPs are assumed to decay into a pair of standard model fermions inside the tracker volume, which results in displaced jets.
      A trigger and selections based on Z boson decays to electron or muon pairs provide sensitivity to light (15 GeV or less) LLPs, which have up to now been difficult to access.
      Decays of LLPs are selected by requiring the presence of displaced jets which are identified using information from the CMS tracking system.
      The results are interpreted in the context of exotic decays of the Higgs boson to LLPs (H\(\to\)SS).
      The search is sensitive to branching fractions \(\mathcal{B}\)(H\(\to\)SS) of 4-5% (less than 20%) for LLP masses of 40 (15) GeV and mean proper decay lengths of 10-100 mm (10-50 mm).

    <h2>Search for long-lived particles decaying in the CMS endcap muon system in proton-proton collisions at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV</h2>
    <p> A search for long-lived particles (LLPs) produced in decays of standard model (SM) Higgs bosons in 137 fb\(^{−1}\) of proton-proton collisions at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV recorded by the CMS experiment during 2016-2018 is presented.
      The search employs a novel technique to reconstruct hadronic decays of LLPs in the endcap muon system.
      The search is sensitive to a broad range of LLP decay modes including \(\tau^-\tau^+\), LLP masses as low as a few GeV, and is largely model-independent.
      No excess of events above the SM background is observed and stringent limits on the Higgs boson (h\(^0\)) branching fraction to LLPs (S) are obtained, particularly for proper decay lengths greater than a few meters.
      This search result represents the most stringent limits on the branching fraction \(\mathcal{B}\)(h\(^0\to\)SS) for proper decay lengths greater than 6-40 m for S masses between 7-40 GeV.

    <h2>A reconfigurable neural network ASIC for detector front-end data compression at the HL-LHC</h2>
    <p>Despite advances in the programmable logic capabilities of modern trigger systems, a significant bottleneck remains in the amount of data to be transported from the detector to off-detector logic where trigger decisions are made.
      We demonstrate that a neural network autoencoder model can be implemented in a radiation tolerant ASIC to perform lossy data compression alleviating the data transmission problem while preserving critical information of the detector energy profile.
      For our application, we consider the high-granularity calorimeter from the CMS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider.
      The advantage of the machine learning approach is in the flexibility and configurability of the algorithm.
      By changing the neural network weights, a unique data compression algorithm can be deployed for each sensor in different detector regions, and changing detector or collider conditions.
      To meet area, performance, and power constraints, we perform a quantization-aware training to create an optimized neural network hardware implementation.
      The design is achieved through the use of high-level synthesis tools and the \(\texttt{hls4ml}\) framework, and was processed through synthesis and physical layout flows based on a LP CMOS 65 nm technology node.
      The flow anticipates 200 Mrad of ionizing radiation to select gates, and reports a total area of 3.6 mm^2 and consumes 95 mW of power.
      The simulated energy consumption per inference is 2.4 nJ.
      This is the first radiation tolerant on-detector ASIC implementation of a neural network that has been designed for particle physics applications.

    <h2>Charged particle tracking via edge-classifying interaction networks</h2>
    <p>Tracker events are naturally represented as graphs by identifying hits as nodes and track segments as edges; given a set of hypothesized edges, edge-classifying graph neural networks (GNNs) predict which correspond to real track segments.
      In this work, we adapt the physics-motivated interaction network (IN) to the problem of charged-particle tracking in the high-pileup conditions expected at the HL-LHC.
      We demonstrate its excellent edge-classification accuracy and tracking efficiency through a suite of measurements at each stage of GNN-based tracking: graph construction, edge classification, and track building.
      The proposed IN architecture is substantially smaller than previously studied GNN tracking architectures, a reduction in size critical for enabling GNN-based tracking in constrained computing environments.
      Furthermore, the IN is easily expressed as a set of matrix operations, making it a promising candidate for acceleration via heterogeneous computing resources.

    <h2>Ps and Qs: Quantization-aware pruning for efficient low latency neural network inference</h2>
    <p>We explore the interplay between pruning and quantization during the training of neural networks for ultra low latency applications targeting high energy physics use cases.
      However, techniques developed for this study have potential application across many other domains.
      We study various configurations of pruning during quantization-aware training, which we term <em>quantization-aware pruning</em> and the effect of techniques like regularization, batch normalization, and different pruning schemes on multiple computational or neural efficiency metrics.
      We find that quantization-aware pruning yields more computationally efficient models than either pruning or quantization alone for our task.
      Further, quantization-aware pruning typically performs similar to or better in terms of computational efficiency compared to standard neural architecture optimization techniques. While the accuracy for the benchmark application may be similar, the information content of the network can vary significantly based on the training configuration.

<h2>MLPF: Efficient machine-learned particle-flow reconstruction using graph neural networks</h2>
<p>In general-purpose particle detectors, the particle flow algorithm may be used to reconstruct a coherent particle-level view of the event by combining information from the calorimeters and the trackers, significantly improving the detector resolution for jets and the missing transverse momentum.
  In view of the planned high-luminosity upgrade of the CERN Large Hadron Collider, it is necessary to revisit existing reconstruction algorithms and ensure that both the physics and computational performance are sufficient in a high-pileup environment.
  Recent developments in machine learning may offer a prospect for efficient event reconstruction based on parametric models.
  We introduce MLPF, an end-to-end trainable machine-learned particle flow algorithm for reconstructing particle flow candidates based on parallelizable, computationally efficient, scalable graph neural networks and a multi-task objective.
  We report the physics and computational performance of the MLPF algorithm on on a synthetic dataset of top quark-antiquark events in HL-LHC running conditions, including the simulation of multiple interaction effects, and discuss potential next steps and considerations towards ML-based reconstruction in a general purpose particle detector.</p>

<h2>The LHC Olympics 2020: A community challenge for anomaly detection in high energy physics</h2>
<p>A new paradigm for data-driven, model-agnostic new physics searches at colliders is emerging, and aims to leverage recent breakthroughs in anomaly detection and machine learning.
  In order to develop and benchmark new anomaly detection methods within this framework, it is essential to have standard datasets.
  To this end, we have created the LHC Olympics 2020, a community challenge accompanied by a set of simulated collider events.
  Participants in these Olympics have developed their methods using an R&D dataset and then tested them on black boxes: datasets with an unknown anomaly (or not).
  This paper will review the LHC Olympics 2020 challenge, including an overview of the competition, a description of methods deployed in the competition, lessons learned from the experience, and implications for data analyses with future datasets as well as future colliders.</p>

<h2>Accelerated charged particle tracking with graph neural networks on FPGAs</h2>

  The two complementary FPGA designs are based on OpenCL, a framework for writing programs that execute across heterogeneous platforms, and \(\texttt{hls4ml}\), a high-level-synthesis-based compiler for neural network to firmware conversion.
  We evaluate and compare the resource usage, latency, and tracking performance of our implementations based on a benchmark dataset.
  We find a considerable speedup over CPU-based execution is possible, potentially enabling such algorithms to be used effectively in future computing workflows and the FPGA-based Level-1 trigger at the CERN Large Hadron Collider.

<h2>Real-time artificial intelligence for accelerator control: A study at the Fermilab Booster</h2>

<h2>FPGAs-as-a-service toolkit (FaaST)</h2>
<p>Computing needs for high energy physics are already intensive and are expected to increase drastically in the coming years.
In this context, heterogeneous computing, specifically as-a-service computing, has the potential for significant gains over traditional computing models.
Although previous studies and packages in the field of heterogeneous computing have focused on GPUs as accelerators, FPGAs are an extremely promising option as well.
A series of workflows are developed to establish the performance capabilities of FPGAs as a service.
Multiple different devices and a range of algorithms for use in high energy physics are studied.
For a small, dense network, the throughput can be improved by an order of magnitude with respect to GPUs as a service.
For large convolutional networks, the throughput is found to be comparable to GPUs as a service.
This work represents the first open-source FPGAs-as-a-service toolkit.

<h2>Inclusive search for highly boosted Higgs bosons decaying to bottom quark-antiquark pairs in proton-proton collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV</h2>
<p>A search for standard model Higgs bosons (\(\mathrm{H}\)) produced with transverse momentum (\(p_\mathrm{T}\)) greater than 450 GeV and decaying to bottom quark-antiquark pairs (\(\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\)) is performed using proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC at \(\sqrt{s}= 13\) TeV. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb\(^{-1}\). The search is inclusive in the Higgs boson production mode. Highly Lorentz-boosted Higgs bosons decaying to \(\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) are reconstructed as single large-radius jets, and are identified using jet substructure and a dedicated b tagging technique based on a deep neural network.
  For a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV, an excess of events above the background assuming no Higgs boson production is observed with a local significance of 2.5 standard deviations (\(\sigma\)), while the expectation is 0.7.
  The corresponding signal strength and local significance with respect to the standard model expectation are \( \mu_\mathrm{H} = 3.7 \pm 1.2 (\mathrm{stat}) ^{+0.6}_{-0.7} (\mathrm{syst}) ^{+0.8}_{−0.5} (\mathrm{theo})\) and \(1.9\,\sigma\).
  Additionally, an unfolded differential cross section as a function of Higgs boson \(p_\mathrm{T}\) for the gluon fusion production mode is presented, assuming the other production modes occur at the expected rates.

<h2>Compressing deep neural networks on FPGAs to binary and ternary precision with \(\texttt{hls4ml}\)</h2>
<p>We present the implementation of binary and ternary neural networks in the \(\texttt{hls4ml}\) library, designed to automatically convert deep neural network models to digital circuits with FPGA firmware.
  We investigate different strategies to reduce networks' resource consumption by reducing the numerical precision of the network parameters to binary or ternary.
  We discuss the trade-off between model accuracy and resource consumption.
  In addition, we show how to balance between latency and accuracy by retaining full precision on a selected subset of network components.
  As examples, we consider two multiclass classification tasks: handwritten digit recognition with the MNIST data set and jet identification with simulated proton-proton collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The binary and ternary implementation has similar performance to the higher precision implementation while using drastically fewer FPGA resources.

<h2>Fast inference of boosted decision trees in FPGAs for particle physics</h2>
<p>We describe the implementation of boosted decision trees in the \(\texttt{hls4ml}\) library, which allows the translation of a trained model into FPGA firmware through an automated conversion process.
  Thanks to its fully on-chip implementation, \(\texttt{hls4ml}\) performs inference of boosted decision tree models with extremely low latency.
  With a typical latency less than 100 ns, this solution is suitable for FPGA-based real-time processing, such as in the Level-1 trigger system of a collider experiment.

        <h2>Interaction networks for the identification of boosted \(H\to b\overline{b}\) decays</h2>
        <p>We develop an algorithm based on an
               interaction network to identify high-momentum
               Higgs bosons decaying to bottom quark-antiquark pairs and
               distinguish them from ordinary jets originating from
               the hadronization of quarks and gluons. Describing the jet shower as a
               combination of particle-to-particle and
               particle-to-vertex interactions, the model is trained
               to learn a jet representation on which the
               classification problem is optimized. The algorithm is
               trained on simulated samples of accurate LHC
               collisions, released by the CMS collaboration on the
               CERN Open Data Portal. The interaction network achieves
               a drastic improvement in the identification performance
	with respect to state-of-the-art algorithms.</p>

        <h2>JEDI-net: a jet identification algorithm based on interaction networks</h2>
        <p>We investigate the performance of a jet identification
           algorithm based on interaction networks (JEDI-net) to
           identify all-hadronic decays of high-momentum heavy
           particles produced at the LHC and distinguish them from
           ordinary jets originating from the hadronization of quarks
	and gluons. The jet dynamics are described as a set of
           one-to-one interactions between the jet constituents. Based
           on a representation learned from these interactions, the
           jet is associated to one of the considered categories. The
           presented models give better results with less model
           parameters than other traditional architectures.</p>

        <h2>FPGA-accelerated machine learning inference as a service for particle physics computing</h2>
        <p>We demonstrate that the acceleration of machine learning
        inference as a service represents a nondisruptive, heterogeneous
        computing solution for particle physics experiments. We retrain the ResNet-50
        convolutional neural network to achieve state-of-the-art
        performance for top quark jet tagging at the LHC and apply a
        ResNet-50 model with transfer learning for neutrino event
        classification. Using Project Brainwave by Microsoft to
        accelerate the ResNet-50 image classification model, we
        achieve average inference times of 60 (10) milliseconds with
        our experimental physics software framework using Brainwave as
        a cloud (edge or on-premises) service, and a maximum throughput of 600-700 inferences per second.</p>

        <h2>Fast inference of deep neural networks in FPGAs for particle physics</h2>
        <p>We develop a package based on high-level Synthesis (HLS) called \(\texttt{hls4ml}\) to build machine
    learning models in FPGAs for extremely low-latency applications
    (less than one microsecond). The use of HLS increases accessibility
    across a broad user community and allows for a drastic decrease in
    firmware development time. We map out FPGA resource usage and
    latency versus neural network hyperparameters to identify the
    problems in particle physics that would benefit from performing
    neural network inference with FPGAs. For a case study jet
    substructure model, we fit well within the available resources of
	modern FPGAs with a latency on the scale of 100 ns.</p>
